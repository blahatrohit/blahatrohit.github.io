					<p>
					April of 2013 I joined Srm University. While sitting of my counselling 
					I looked at the list of options for branches that I had to choose from. 
					I was interested in electronics engineering as I thought it will provide me
				 	the skills and knowledge to make stuff but my father being the self declared 
				 	savior of my life wanted me to take up software engineering as my subject 
				 	of study, his logic you will be working in a AC room after you get a job 
				 	and not in a workshop. As most Indian students I was pushed into a world 
				 	of unknown, but being a lifetime optimist I took up the challenge and 
				 	thought of giving the software world a shot my expectations being that 
				 	I will be developing hi class apps and software’s when I graduate. <br><br>
				 	</p>

					<p>
					When I completed 2 years of my course in software engineering, I like
					most of my peers was experimenting languages like C, C++ and java. 
					When people ask me which programming language I like the most I say
					Java due it object oriented nature, and having the flexibility to 
					be used on any operating system, but truth be told I liked java 
					because I don’t have to stare at the life less black and blue 
					Turbo C screens on my computer.<br>
 					I soon learned that though I understood programming it is not something 
 					that I would do for the rest of my life, but I had no way out of that 
 					life which I was heading to as I had invested far too much to be there. 
 					My only option being force myself to fall in love with programming. 
 					It is really important for me to fall in love with what I do I will 
 					never prefer it any other way.<br><br>
 					</p>

					<p>
					Social media was a huge thing and having a good amount of likes on 
					Facebook profile image was the what my age of people used to do.
					A good profile image was important so I tried to find different ways 
					to add filters to my images to make it better, this was where I was 
					introduced to Photoshop. It was fascinating to see how an application 
					can transform the entire image to make it more expressive. <br><br>
					</p>

					<p>
					Photoshop was complicated but I learned few simple things like resizing 
					images. Another craze of the time was sticking printed posters. 
					Posters were generally costly to buy online due to the excessive shipping 
					charges but cheap to print. To make some quick bucks I started supplying 
					my college friends with printed posters. Photoshop was an invaluable 
					tool for this. Word began to spread about the Photoshop guy who supplied 
					posters. All the profits were generally shared between me and my 
					roommate who brought in most of my customers. <br><br>
					<p>

					<p>A few months down the road, I was introduced to an aspiring entrepreneur 
					who wanted me to design custom posters for his website to sell all over 
					India. As much interested I was to take up the job, I wasn’t sure if I 
					will be able to deliver as I had never designed a poster myself, 
					generally I used to copy stuff from google. Needless to say I took up 
					the job and for the next week I say in hours on youtube gathering the 
					necessary skills to learn photoshop and graphic designing.<br><br>
					By January of 2016 
					<a href="https://www.blahink.com" target="_blank" style="color:#ff0202;">
					www.blahink.com
					</a>
					was launched, with me as the lead designer on 
					team.<br><br>
					</p>

					<p>
					Designing is something that I fell in love with and lost all 
					interest in coding. As the seasons for placements came in and 
					recruiters started recruiting all my friends, I had no doubt that 
					I don’t be placed in a top notch company and would end up working 
					for a service based company. <br><br>
					</p>


					<p>
					But luck would have it Payoda Technologies came up with a open position 
					for a Ux resource, I dint know what ux was but regardless I applied as 
					they had asked for designers. Looking back the entire process of my 
					interviews and assessments seem unreal, it was when I was giving the 
					assessment for the job that I realized that I had learned a lot in the 
					past two year.<br><br>
					</p>

					<p>
					I started of with designing to put up better pictures on facebook never
					had I imagined that a small incident like that will take me places.<br><br>

					That only after you're there, can you then connect the dots. 
					“You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them 
					looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect 
					in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, 
					karma, whatever.  <br>
