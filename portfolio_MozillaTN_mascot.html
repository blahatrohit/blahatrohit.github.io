						</p>

					<p class="blog_header">
					PHASE 2: Research, Gathering Concepts<br><br>
					</p>
						<p>
						The process started with the research phase. 
						Pinterest was a very handy tool for the inspiration for the mascot. 
						With the research phase I provided the client with a selection of 
						sketches of different mascots, that I felt resonated with their requirement.
						<br>
						</p>
<div class="blog_image">
<img src="images/portfolio/MozillaTN_mascot/drawing.jpg"/><br>
</div>						<p>
						With the feed back in mind, I proceeded with the last design of the Fox.<br><br>
						</p>

					<p class="blog_header">
					PHASE 3: Prototyping<br><br>
					</p>
						<p>
						Within 2 days of the request, I had completed the first iteration
						of the design. .<br>
						</p> 
<div class="blog_image">
<img src="images/portfolio/MozillaTN_mascot/1stitreation.jpg"/><br>	
</div>
						<p>
						The client then had a different request from the design in his 
						exact words 
						<p class="blog_answer">“Is there anything that could be added to the mascot, 
						that would create an image like, it belongs to tamilnadu?” .
						<p>
						This turned out to be ever more challenging than it sounded at the time.<br>
						With a days research and different concepts being shared finally it 
						was decided that the fox should be dressed in as a conventional 
						Tamil bhramin.<br><br>
						</p>

						<p class="blog_header">
						PHASE 4: Delivery<br><br>
						</p>
						
							<p>
							The accepted design :-<br>

<div class="blog_image">
<img src="images/portfolio/MozillaTN_mascot/MASCOTweb.jpg"/><br>	
</div>
							<p>
							I was also ask to provide mock ups Stickers, Tshirts, and 
							posters, all of which is free to download at my 
							github handle.
